# What Day Is It? 📅

This simple JavaScript project uses a `prompt` to ask the user what day it is and then displays a fun message using a `switch` statement.

## How it Works 💡

1.  The script asks the user to enter the day of the week.
2.  It converts the user's input to lowercase to handle different capitalization.
3.  A `switch` statement checks the day and displays a corresponding message.
4.  If the input is invalid, it shows an error message.

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

1.  Open the `index.js` file in your web browser's developer console.  You can usually do this by pressing F12.
2.  The prompt will appear asking you for the day.
3.  Enter the day and see the message!

## What I Learned 📈

This project helped me practice:

*   Using the `prompt` function to get user input.
*   Working with `switch` statements for conditional logic.
*   Converting strings to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()`.
