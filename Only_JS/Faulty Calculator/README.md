# Faulty Calculator 🤪

This is a "Faulty Calculator" project built with JavaScript. It's designed to introduce a bit of unpredictable behavior into basic arithmetic calculations. Think of it as a fun way to explore how errors can sometimes creep into code!

## How it Works ⚙️

This calculator performs standard arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /, \*\*, %) but with a twist. There's a 10% chance that the calculation will be "faulty," meaning it will use the *wrong* operation. For example, if you try to add two numbers, it might subtract them instead!

## Features ✨

*   Performs basic arithmetic calculations (+, -, \*, /, \*\*, %)
*   Input validation to ensure numbers are entered
*   Handles division by zero errors
*   10% chance of "faulty" calculations (using the wrong operator)

## How to use 🚀

1.  Open the [Live Demo](https://us-js-faulty-calculator.netlify.app).
2.  **OR** to run the code locally:
    *   Open your web browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12).
    *   Copy and paste the entire `index.js` code into the console.
    *   Press Enter to run the code.
3.  Enter the first number when prompted.
4.  Enter the operator (+, -, \*, /, \*\*, %) when prompted.
5.  Enter the second number when prompted.
6.  The result will be displayed in an alert box. Be prepared for surprises! 😉
