# Even or Odd Checker 🔢

This simple JavaScript project determines whether a given number is even or odd.  A classic beginner project that reinforces fundamental programming concepts!

## How it Works ⚙️

The user is prompted to enter a number. The code then uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.  The result is displayed in an alert box.

## Features ✨

*   Prompts the user for numerical input.
*   Input validation to ensure a valid number is entered.
*   Determines if the number is even or odd.
*   Displays the result in an alert.
