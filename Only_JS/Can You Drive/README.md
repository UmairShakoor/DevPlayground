# Can You Drive? 🚗🚦

This simple JavaScript project checks if you're old enough to drive!  A fun way to practice input validation and conditional logic.

## How it Works ⚙️

The user is prompted to enter their age. The code then checks if the age falls within the valid range (10-66) and if it meets the driving age requirements.  The result is displayed in an alert box.

## Features ✨

* Prompts the user for their age.
* Validates input to ensure it's a number within the allowed range.
* Determines driving eligibility based on age.
* Displays the result in an alert.

2.  *OR* Copy and paste the JavaScript code into your browser's developer console (F12).
